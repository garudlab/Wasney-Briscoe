# Demonstration with example data

We have provided examples of MIDAS species, genes, and snps outputs. The species outputs contain information on all species detected in this mouse dataset; contrastingly, we have only provided the MIDAS genes and snps output files for _B. vulgatus_ (Bacteroides_vulgatus_57955) due to the size of these files. As a result, the provided species files can be used to produce all plots related to taxonomic composition and diversity (e.g., figure 2; supplementary figure 1). Meanwhile, the genes and snps outputs can be used to to run the post-processing, $\pi$, and strain phasing pipelines for _B. vulgatus_ only. Below, we provide step-by-step unstructions on how to demonstrate these pipelines with the _B. vulgatus_-data, as well as how to plot the resulting strain and SNV frequencies for this species.
