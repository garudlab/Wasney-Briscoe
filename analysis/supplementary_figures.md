# Creating supplementary figures

First, we create a file called `sample_ploid_status.txt`, which contains information on whether a species has one (haploid) or multiple (polyploid) strains in each sample in which it is detected. To generate this file, run `calculate_ploid.py` at [Wasney-Briscoe-2024/scripts/supplementary_figures/calculate_ploid.py](https://github.com/garudlab/Wasney-Briscoe-2024/tree/main/scripts/supplementary_figures/calculate_ploid.py), using python 2.7 to do so (e.g., in a python 2.7-based conda environment). `calculate_ploid.py` generates the file `sample_ploid_status.txt` in the `Wasney-Briscoe-2024/metadata/` subdirectory.

Next, run `figure_S2B.R` in [`Wasney-Briscoe-2024/scripts/supplementary_figures/figure_S2B.R`](https://github.com/garudlab/Wasney-Briscoe-2024/tree/main/scripts/figures/figure_S2B.R).

This script will output `figure_S2B.png` in your home directory (`~/`).

## Figure 3

Run `figure_4.R` in [`Wasney-Briscoe-2024/scripts/figures/figures_4.R`](https://github.com/garudlab/Wasney-Briscoe-2024/tree/main/scripts/figures/figure_3.R).

This script will output `figure_4.png` in your home directory (`~/`).

## Figure 4

Run `figure_4.R` in [`Wasney-Briscoe-2024/scripts/figures/figures_5.R`](https://github.com/garudlab/Wasney-Briscoe-2024/tree/main/scripts/figures/figure_5.R).

This script will output `figure_5.png` in your home directory (`~/`).
