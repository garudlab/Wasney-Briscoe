# Metadata

This folder contains the metadata used for analysis in this paper. The attached `metadata.csv` holds the following information:
- `accession`: accession number for the sample
- `sample_id`: sample id for the sample. sample id is formatted such that the second element holds a number indicating the mouse; the next 1-2 elements indicate gut region (D = duodenum; J = jejunum; I = ileum; Ce = cecum; Co = colon); and the final element indicates diet (C = Control; G = Guar Gum). TL1 indicates the inoculum, sourced from patient TL1.
- `tissue_type`: tissue type of the same. This corresponds to one of the five sites sampled along the guts within mice, or in the case of the inoculum, stool.
- `subject_id`: mouse number of the sample. 0 indicates inoculum.
- `Diet`: Diet that the mouse subject was placed on for weeks 7 and 8 post-inoculation. The inoculum had "Human Diet," as it was sourced from human host TL1.
- `coarse_position`: "Upper gut" indicates small intestine (i.e., duodenum, jejunum, ileum), and "Lower gut" indicates large intestine (i.e., cecum and colon).
